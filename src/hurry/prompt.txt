My mobile phone rang. Michael said his sister told him I was in town, and did I want to get together like, now? 
Yes, I said. But thereâ€™s something I want to tell you. While I waited in the cafe for him, I did a thing people do but rarely say they do, 
lest they seem irrational or naive, or maybe that was my own false prejudice, hardened in the threads of cynicism I clung to, 
lest I be rendered irrational or naive: I imagined our lives together, one year from now, five, twenty.
